  ## Description

  - Motivation: A lot of routing can back an absolute handful to manage, so I wanted to learn how to mange those connections better as well as familiarize myself with mongoose and MongoDB.
  - Problem solved: My understanding in expresss routing and mongoose was lacking, so I decided to practice creating a full Back-End server with those proccesses.
  - What was learned: I learned a ton about how the modles and shemas can work together in a mangoose and MongoDB environment. I also learn how to use Insomnia in great quantities using json inports.
